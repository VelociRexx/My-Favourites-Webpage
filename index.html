      These are some of my favourite things I would like to share
    </p>

    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <img src="img/family.jpg" alt="Family Tiles" width="600" />
    <p>
      I love my family more than anything in the world. They are my world, and I
      wouldn't give them up for anything.
    </p>
    <h3>Members of my family include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My Mother</li>
      <li>My Father</li>
      <li>My Brother</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My imediate family isn't all, my extended family is also very important to
      me.
    </p>
    <h3>Members of my extened family incude:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My Grandparents</li>
      <li>The Galbraiths</li>
      <li>The Surgenors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these people are very important to me, and are my favourite people.
    </p>

    <h2>My Cat</h2>
    <img src="img/IMG_4986.jpg" alt="Picture of my Cat" width="600" />
    <p>
      My cat is the most loveable <i>POS</i> I've ever known. She knows exactly
      how to get what she wants by manipulating us, and at the same time, she's
      just a cute cat that loves attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got her around the beginning of covid times, and I've seen her grow
      from a little pebble who could sleep in my hands to a cat able to jump
      <b>2 meters</b> into the air, knocks every last item off of my desk, and
      is smarter than me sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My family has 2 dogs as well, but my cat is my litte
      <u><i id="label"></i></u>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <img src="img/computer.jpg" alt="Computer Image" width="600" />
    <p>
      No teanager's favourites list would be complete without video games, and
      that isn't an exception for me. They are a great way to just have fun
      after a hard day of work, and if you can find one that you enjoy enough,
      time will fly past you.
    </p>
    <h3>Some of my favourite games include:</h3>

      These aren't all the games I play, but they are the ones I have the most
      fun while playing. They are all excelently well made and are some of the
      most fun I've ever had
