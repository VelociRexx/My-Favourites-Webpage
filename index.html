    <img src="img/family.jpg" alt="Family Tiles" width="600" />
    <p>
      I love my family more than anything in the world. They are my world, and I
      wouldn't give them up for anything
    </p>
    <h3>Members of my family include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My Mother</li>
      <li>My Father</li>
      <li>My Brother</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My imediate family isn't all, my extended family is also very important to
      me
    </p>
    <h3>Members of my extened family incude</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My Grandparents</li>
      <li>The Galbraiths</li>
      <li>The Surgenors</li>

    <h2>My Cat</h2>
    <img src="img/IMG_4986.jpg" alt="Picture of my Cat" width="600" />
    <p>
      My cat is the most loveable <i>POS</i> I've ever known. She knows exactly
      how to get what she wants by manipulating us, and at the same time, she's
      just a cute cat that loves attention
    </p>
    <p>
      We got her around the beginning of covid times, and I've seen her grow
      from a little pebble who could sleep in my hands to a cat able to jump
      <b>2 meters</b> into the air, knocks every last item off of my desk, and
      is smarter than me sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>My family has 2 dogs as well, but my cat is mine litte <i>conard</i></p>
